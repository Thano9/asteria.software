# Asteria Software Website

## Project Overview

This is the official website for Asteria Software, built as a modern, animated portfolio showcasing our products and applications. The site features a clean, minimalist design with sophisticated animations and interactive elements.

## Design Philosophy

- **Simplicity First**: Clean, uncluttered interface that puts content front and center
- **Animation-Driven**: Smooth, purposeful animations that enhance user experience
- **Performance-Focused**: Optimized for fast loading and smooth interactions
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design that works beautifully on all devices

## Key Features

### Animated Landing Page
- Staggered loading sequence with blur-to-focus transitions
- Spring physics for natural motion
- Interactive project cards with hover effects

### Project Showcase
- Reusable ProjectCard component for easy content management
- Support for custom project icons and external links
- Hover animations with scale and color transitions

### Modern Tech Stack
- Next.js 15 with App Router for optimal performance
- Motion (Framer Motion) for smooth animations
- Vanilla CSS with Google Fonts for custom typography
- Lucide React for consistent iconography

## Typography System

- **Instrument Serif**: Elegant serif font for the main "ASTERIA" title
- **Nanum Brush Script**: Handwritten style for the "SOFTWARE" subtitle
- **Chivo Mono**: Clean monospace font for project card text

## Animation Timeline

1. **0.1s**: Main container fades in
2. **0.2s**: Title block (ASTERIA + SOFTWARE) animates together
3. **1.1s**: First project card appears after dramatic pause
4. **1.2s**: Second project card follows
5. **1.3s**: Third project card completes the sequence
6. **1.6s**: All interactions become available

## Development Notes

- Removed Tailwind CSS in favor of vanilla CSS for better control
- Simplified CSS Grid to absolute positioning for the header layout
- Implemented proper loading state management to prevent premature interactions
- Used semantic HTML structure for accessibility

## Future Enhancements

- Add more project cards as new products are developed
- Implement dark mode support
- Add contact form or additional pages
- Integrate with a CMS for easier content management
